# HR Analytics – Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **HR Analytics using Logistic Regression** to predict employee outcomes based on historical HR data. The objective is to analyze employee-related factors and build a machine learning model that helps in decision-making such as employee retention and performance prediction.

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Logistic Regression**
  - Supervised classification algorithm
  - Used for binary classification problems
  - Interprets the relationship between independent variables and a categorical outcome

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and understanding  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Feature selection and encoding  
5. Model building using Logistic Regression  
6. Model evaluation and interpretation  

## 📈 Results
The Logistic Regression model successfully classified employee outcomes with reliable accuracy. The results highlight key HR factors influencing employee behavior and provide actionable insights for HR decision-making.

## 🚀 Applications
- Employee attrition prediction  
- HR decision support systems  
- Workforce analytics  
- Talent management  

## 📂 Files in Repository
- `HR(LogRe).ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing full implementation of HR Analytics using Logistic Regression

## 🧩 Future Improvements
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform feature importance analysis
- Improve model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
